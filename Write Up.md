## Abstract
Problem, what you did, what was found

## Introduction
For this project we looked at survey data from an international non-profit. The data was collected from volunteers at three points during their service: following Orientation (OR), Mid-Service (MS), and End-of-Service (EOS) trainings. The three surveys are different, but there are some consistent questions across the surveys particularly MS and EOS. 

Initial explorations focused on understanding the surveys and pulling out questions that seemed interesting to analyze. Our initial question was, "What contributes to the growth of WT volunteers?" We looked through all the surveys and grouped questions on themes: self-assesment, education office, staff, safety, and training. We also found questions relating to satisfaction and whether the volunteer would recommend WorldTeach. 

After identifying the sets of questions, we cleaned up the sheets to standardize the header rows, and processed the data to calculate the avearage responses across countries for the three surveys.
