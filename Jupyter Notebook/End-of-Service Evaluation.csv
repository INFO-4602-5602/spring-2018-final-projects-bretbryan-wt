However, that changed entirely when we got Melissa, who has been incredible. She got up to speed in such a short time and was adept at communicating, managing, and supporting us.",Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,"My time in Thailand has improved my confidence in my ability to navigate difficult, confusing situations.

Not everything works the first time.",Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"I wish I had known better how to prepare lessons, and how much time would be spent in class and out per week. I came into WorldTeach thinking I would have a lot more free time than I actually did. Granted, my roommate, the other volunteer, had loads of free time, but he barely spent any time preparing lessons. It wouldn't be exaggerating to say that I spent 50-60 hours per week on work for school.","My most memorable experiences this year include:  - The time one of my classes of students asked to transfer into my English club class, and when I asked them why, they said ""Teacher, it is funny [sic] to learn with you.""  - The time one of my best students from my first semester, who I didn't teach with in the second semester, told me he missed learning with me. Or rather, he was too shy, so the other best student, a girl, told me :)  - When my roommate and I both got some kind of food poisoning for a week and went to the hospital with a teacher's husband, who didn't speak any English, and we had to try to communicate the problem at the E.R., with no English. Then the next morning, being woken up at 6 AM by our neighbors who thought they had to drive us to the hospital again.","I learned about my ability to communicate simply and clearly, and about the kind of resolve it takes to navigate challenging situations.","The most difficult thing for me about this experience was lesson planning. Especially in the first semester, I felt very unprepared for lesson planning. I would scour the internet for resources, and look through the book, but nothing seemed designed for the level of our students and their age. For example, resources that were at their level would be aimed at 2-3 year olds, and resources that were age appropriate would be aimed at almost fluent speakers, but rarely would resources be age appropriate AND assume a low level of competency.    I confronted this challenge by reading a couple TEFL books (the Teach For America ""Instructional Planning and Delivery"" guide, available online, changed the game for me. Jeremy Harper's ""How to Teach English"" was also a great resource), and by meeting with the WorldTeach Director of Education (Matthew) multiple times. When Melissa became our FD, I met with her a couple times, and she was supremely helpful in helping me be more efficient.","Flexibility, improvisation, organization, independence, and self-motivation.","More time spent lesson planning does not necessarily correlate with better lessons. There is a point at which you are agonizing over details and not actually improving the lesson. If possible, try to teach the same lesson to multiple classes, and refine the lesson each time you teach it based on what you notice works and does not work. Don't be afraid to try new things and to experiment. Start with a base of ""cookie cutter"" activities that you can draw from, and then incorporate your own creative ideas. Get the students talking as much as you can, and reduce the amount of time you lecture/talk to a minimum. Do your best to make the rules for an activity intuitive -- imagine a student wasn't listening; can they still figure out what to do? Don't pack a lot -- you can get almost anything you need here, either in your town or in Nakhon Phanom. When you're offered a new food, or something unique/funny happens, when you're teaching something new in class -- ask your students how you say it in Thai. It really goes a long way to showing you're interested in their culture too. Try to incorporate the Thai you learn this way into your conversations throughout the year, even if it's 99% English and 1% Thai. Get out of your house; don't hide away in your farang comforts. Even if you want to work, go outside in the shade somewhere, or to a cafe. Go work at your school, or at a neighbor's house. Be available. If you can afford it, when you go buy coffee/tea, get an extra one and give it to a colleague.",Agree,"I got out a lot out of my year, and overall it was a positive experience. I did however want to mention a few things that could improve the experience for volunteers in the future, and also improve WorldTeach's reputation in Thailand.    Several of our volunteers expressed from the very beginning that the main reason they were here was ""to have fun."" That mindset explained some of the immaturity in our group this year, from people being very late to PLCs, missing PLCs and not submitting lesson plans or making up the PLC, and in at least one case, being actively disrespectful to hotel staff which resulted in someone getting accosted by police in the beginning of the year. Volunteers were rarely held accountable (in the first half of the year), and by the second month of teaching, I heard volunteers say things like ""what are they going to do, fire me?"" I took this commitment very seriously (in some ways, maybe too seriously), and I know I can be high-strung, but that kind of behavior made me feel like this service wasn't as important as I thought it was. Probably WorldTeach gets a limited pool of applicants each year, so it might not be possible to vet applicants anymore than you already do. Instead, having more language in the application materials and during orientation (and throughout the program) about the seriousness of the commitment could help.    Socially, I wish our group had been encouraged to be more cohesive, to reach out to each other, to visit each other. I think it would have added greatly to my experience if, as part of PLC duties, I had to visit one other school and observe one of the volunteers teaching and report back to the group any differences I noticed between our styles of teaching and between our schools. As it was, I felt isolated from the group.    Lastly, the funding situation was confusing to me. I know that WorldTeach is undergoing major reorganization, but I thought it might be helpful to report from my perspective. As I understand it, we were each getting paid around 8,000 Baht, but our schools were paying WorldTeach around 24,000 Baht. If that is correct, I found this troubling for a few reasons. Compared to WorldTeach's competitors in Thailand, e.g., CIEE, other teachers doing much the same work, even in Nakhon Phanom, were getting paid basically the same thing our schools were paying WorldTeach. I know we are considered ""volunteers"" to WorldTeach, but our schools were paying us the equivalent of 2-3 full-time Thai teachers, so to them we weren't volunteers at all. If the schools' payments are to remain this high, I think the ""volunteers"" should get more of it -- perhaps 2/3 instead of 1/3, with the remaining 1/3 paying for the FD and admin/overhead. Or, preferably, reduce the school's payment substantially, and reduce the volunteer stipend as well. Otherwise, why should an applicant apply to WorldTeach instead of CIEE or Media Kids? The issue comes down to the mismatch between the schools' high contributions and the volunteers' low-ish stipends.    I hope this feedback is helpful. I don't mean it to be too negative. I really appreciate the support I've gotten from WorldTeach over the course of the year, and the opportunity to live and work in this beautiful place surrounded by friendly people.",Volunteer Program,,,,,,,,,"I will be traveling around Southeast Asia for a few months, and then hopefully going to New Zealand on a work holiday visa for an indeterminate amount of time.

I did not realize how reliant I was on my native language unit I moved to Thailand.  I had moments where I was completely frustrated with myself and others because I could not tell them how I felt about something or place a food order for a meal I wanted (besides pad thai).  I was never thrilled about learning a new language in school, but I forced myself to go outside of my comfort zone and to push myself in a new direction that I had never explored before.  After the initial frustration, I began to ask my students and teachers to teach me simple Thai phrases to help me get by, and they were more than happy to share that part of their culture and heritage with me.  It opened the door to building strong friendships and relationships with my community and school.

One of my shoes broke, my sweat took almost all the glitter off the earrings I was wearing, and by the end of it, all of us were absolutely dead. That night, I honestly could not walk. I was hobbling around like a grandma, covered from head to toe in icy hot.

Before this experience, I knew I wanted to work in education, but I wasn't sure the classroom was the place for me. But now, I know that even with limited communication between myself and the students, teaching is where it's at for me. ","Definitely the hardest thing for me was living with a host family. I had the best host family in the world, and I have a great relationship with them. But being as independent as I am, it was really hard to be mothered by someone again. I figured the best solution was to try to meet somewhere in the middle. So, I explained in my best Spanish that Americans value a lot of independence and personal space, that when I needed it, I would go to my room, and that it didn't mean I was upset or angry or that something was wrong; it just meant I wanted to write in my journal or listen to music and have some alone time. I also said that if they ever felt like I was spending too much time alone, or if they worried about me, they could always talk to me about it, and never to feel uncomfortable talking to me about their concerns. I also bought a pack of playing cards, and tried to spend most nights playing a game after we cleaned up dinner, so we got to spend some family time together. I think for the most part, we did a pretty good job of managing family time and personal time, it just required a lot of effort and understanding on all of our parts.

We were split into teaching pairs (one with more teaching experience and one with less), assigned a grade, given a textbook, and told to come up with a unit plan for the week. We co-taught our lessons to the students at the school. Each day we were observed by a different staff member and given feedback. And at the end of the week, we had a really long session dedicated to debriefing practicum. It was an awful lot of work, and I remember being extremely stressed out for that whole week, but it also gave all of us context to discuss all of the TEFL theory we were learning, and I learned so much in that week! I remember a lot of the fellows in the GEF saying the educational component of orientation was too much theory and not enough practice. I think finding some way to incorporate a teaching practicum into orientation would be helpful, not only because volunteers can learn a lot from it, but also from a retention standpoint. I think people were caught off-guard by some of the harsh realities of TEFL when they went to site and actually started teaching, and I think being able to pinpoint issues before sending volunteers to site could not only mean more and better-targeted support during orientation, but also if someone gets to country and realizes teaching just isn't for them during teaching practicum, they don't then go to site, quit halfway through, and potentially burn a bridge with a local partner school.

Both Mid-Service and End of Service took up 3 days of our time, and each could have easily been done within a single afternoon more socially and organically without so much time wasted on forced bonding/sharing activities. There were a lot of expected deliverables that were poorly explained, often requiring multiple emails until concrete instructions were finally laid out. The weekly check-ins and travel texts felt like babysitting at best, and surveillance at worst. Whenever there was actually a real issue that I needed help with, somehow someone was always on vacation or couldn't do anything without asking several different people for permission to move forward. It seemed nothing ever got resolved, or I never got an actual answer better than ""we'll look into it"" unless I directly went straight to the Field Director for support. If it wasn't for the outstanding support and personal networks of my host family, I doubt I would have lasted even halfway through the program. Most if not all of us in the program felt that we were talked down to in condescending tones, whether in emails or during the conferences; we also felt like we were treated as if we were clueless children. It also was not helpful or reassuring to be given very overly optimistic and misleading information about our sites by people who've never lived in the communities. Not to mention, my host family was shocked and concerned after the Site Visit when they commented that the Assistant Field Director had very poor Spanish abilities, worse than the volunteer living with them who had only started conversing in Spanish when they arrived in November.

I saw the stellar reputation online from past volunteers and the fact there was an orientation that promised strong teacher preparation and cultural orientation, but felt both lacking. When I had real problems that I needed external help with, I feel like WorldTeach always wanted me to wait to do anything when that's simply not possible when the school or Edificar would throw something on you at the last minute and expect you to go with it. Also, orientation seemed to spend more time on safety and behavior, which felt more like a checklist that the field staff was legally obligated to exhaustively go through so that volunteers would not be able to litigate if something terrible happened, then on actual teacher training or cultural preparation. It seemed to boil down to ""lesson planning will save your life"" without giving us any real examples applicable to the Ecuadorian culture or the rural education system as many of the techniques advised simply don't work here. I talked to as many of the volunteers with professional teaching experience prior to WorldTeach about their classrooms, and the consensus seemed to be that the techniques or approaches sensitive to the students' needs and lives that would work back home in the US were ineffective here. Likewise, many of the practical advice offered in PLCs were impossible due to resource restrictions, like decorating your classroom to subtly define it as your territory with your rules or showing up to class before the students; neither possible in schools where the students stay in the same classroom all day and the teachers rotate every class period.

Maybe if we didn't have the TEFL and the PLCs and the project to worry about while juggling it with teaching responsibilities and personal lives, I would have dedicated more time to it.

It also would have been great if my AFD had confirmed receipt of required documentation (e.g. weekly check-ins, travel texts, upload of PLC documents to Google drive folder).  I am very satisfied with how quickly WorldTeach acted when I needed to be moved out of my original host family's house for safety concerns.  I also appreciate the help and support that the Director of Education provided when I was struggling with adjusting to life in the classroom. ",Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,"My experience with WorldTeach has strengthened each of these characteristics.  First, being a member of the inaugural cohort of the Global Education Fellowship I had to learn how to be more patient, adaptable, and resilient as we waded through unknowns, many changes, and communication challenges.  I learned to be more resourceful as I adapted to a new job in a new and different educational system wrought with lack of communication and many surprises.  I became more culturally competent by living with a host family, working with local teachers, and always trying to learn about and participate in cultural traditions.  I think I became more emotionally intelligent by learning how to live in a fairly isolated site, and persevering through a challenging first couple months even though I kind of wanted to leave. ",Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,"I wish I had known exactly how difficult teaching would be.  I came into this program thinking that the research and teaching components of the fellowship would be more balanced, however I greatly underestimated how much time and effort serving as a full-time EFL teacher for approximately 400 students would require.  I also had to complete many of the same administrative requirements as local teachers, which was time-consuming.  I think it really needs to be emphasized to future program participants that you are for all intents and purposes a full-time public school teacher, it will be hard, and you shouldn't join the fellowship program if you are interested primarily in the research.","I have many memorable experiences from the past 7.5 months.  However, one thing that stands out is participating in the cultural events surrounding Inti Raymi, the sun festival.  My school participated in a parade in my hub city of Cayambe, and teachers performed a choreographed dance at our Family Day.  I really enjoyed learning traditional songs, perfecting a dance, and getting the opportunity to dance through the streets in the traditional women's outfit for my region. ","I learned how resilient I can be.  I was very close to leaving the program, but am so glad I stuck it out.  I learned that now matter how hard it seems, no matter how much you feel like you don't know what you are doing, and no matter how much you question your impact, with hard work, good friends, and advice from others, you really can make it through. ","Teaching.  I am a first-time teacher, and all of the struggles typically faced by new teachers was magnified by the sheer volume of students I had.  I was spending way too much time grading notebooks and assessments, and working 10-12 hours days, which was not sustainable.  I confronted this challenge by talking to certified educators in my cohort and by Skyping with the Director of Education.  Matthew suggested doing more informal assessments during class to cut down on time spent grading outside of the classroom, which was really helpful. ","flexibility, resiliency, confidence, good time-management skills, adaptability, a sense of humor, creativity","Be prepared for the unexpected.  Learn to roll with the punches.

There was a lack of professionalism, ability to be reactive, and general lack of empathy in dealing with volunteer situations. I felt that the staff was excellent at planning events that had plenty of preparation time such as Mid-service and End of Service conferences. However, generally the field staff struggled with uncertainty and reacting to the unexpected which would describe most situations given the pilot nature of the program. There was a point during orientation when we were filling out a visa form and following Lindsay's instruction. While we filled out the form, volunteers pointed out the variation in information she was giving us from the information she had previously sent us. She repeatedly said that she knew what she was doing defensively. The issue was not whether she was knowledgeable or not. The issue was how she was carrying herself and responding to volunteers. She was impatient, defensive and generally left a bad first impression on all of us from the beginning. On the flip side, Lindsay was empathetic with the many volunteers who fell ill during orientation and did a great job supporting us. I did not feel that I was adequately supported when I was mugged outside of my home. I received a call immediately following my mugging and I mentioned that my local phone was stolen from me the previous Friday while my iphone and laptop had just been taken from me. As I was incredibly emotionally distressed, I don't think it was an appropriate time to immediately point out WT policy requiring me to have a telephone even though there were only a few weeks left in the program. That night I sent Mecca an email stating that I was considering leaving the program since this was the 3rd time I was robbed. In the future I would recommend a reply email along the lines of: I'm sorry to hear about what you have gone through. I understand your feelings and will respect anything you decide to do. Please take some time for yourself and keep me posted on how I can help you. I would recommend you give yourself a day to think clearly because you've been through something traumatic.     Instead I got an immediate reply asking me whether this would be an early termination or would I be attending End of Service. Personally I like Mecca but in a program where most of the communication takes place via email then phone, I think she needs to understand how to convey empathy. It was literally the most scared I had ever been and that was not the support and/or words I needed via telephone or email. I also never received a follow up for the WT incident report and I'm surprised that WT didn't even offer to move me considering that their was a pair waiting on my street who robbed me outside of my home. I'm surprised that WT was never interested to hear what happened to me from my own mouth. It was overall disappointing to say the least.

All of my classes enjoyed the game but one class in particular was enthralled by it. During the game the students worked in teams to race some fomx fish across waves on the board by answering review questions. The energy in the room was palpable and even my reserved students were rapidly flipping through their notebooks to find the answer, or arguing with their teammates about the correct answer. It was a blast! The students took missed answers with grace and were determined to know the next question correctly. I will never forget the uproar when the final group won and how they begged to play again (we did play again on another day of course). My heart was so full to see them taking such an active interest in making sure they knew the answer. I will also never forget the first time I experienced a ‚Äúvolcano drill‚Äù at school. Back home in Ohio I have participated in countless tornado drills but never did I consider the possibility of or the hilarity of a volcano drill. Watching the rows of students with hands on their heads walking into the center of the school compound, sirens blaring for the first time I had no idea what was going on, I could only chuckle to myself ‚Äòonly in Ecuador‚Äô and walk with my hands on my head too.   While in Ecuador I greatly enjoyed spending my weekends traveling. After spending the past year in Guyana, where in country travel was expensive and difficult due to a lack of development I was shocked and excited by how easy travel in Ecuador is. Because the country is so small I doesn‚Äôt take very long to get from one place to another. My favorite moment in Ecuador was on one of my weekend adventures, this particular time to Tena. While visiting other volunteers in the beautiful Amazon we found our way to Puyo and a giant jungle swing. I have never felt joy like I did with the wind rushing through my hair as I swung out over the rainforest. This memory will stay with me for a lifetime, a constant reminder to take the leap because the joy that follows is worth getting over the initial fear",The most interesting thing that I learned about myself is that I do not enjoy teaching a special. Having over 350 students was overwhelming and I did not enjoy that aspect of the experience. ,The most difficult experience for me here in Ecuador was the language barrier.

This leaves me in need of finding something in the mean time and a back up plan if things with the Peace Corps don‚Äôt pan out. In terms of general life goals, I know that I want to continue my work in the field of education and will eventually need to attend grad school, however I find myself in a position where I am overwhelmed with interests and options and am finding it difficult to narrow my focus to make a choice. WorldTeach has expanded my view of those possibilities, I see the world as holding opportunity, not just the U.S., or even only my state.

In particular, I had a student named Mart√≠n who developed a lot as a student. He was in the seventh grade and at the beginning of the term he had a hard time focusing and remembering vocabulary and always seemed overwhelmed during class. But then, we started developing a personal connection, and he started trying harder and putting in a visible effort for each class. He also folded me a number of pieces of origami, which he gave to me as gifts, and which seemed to mark a turning point in his learning English. But the end of the year, he would light up whenever he saw me, sit at the front of the class, listening attentively and actively participating, and improving his scores gradually, but consistently. During my last month, he also started asking me questions about words he was interested and keeping his own mini personal vocabulary list, separate from what we were learning in class, which he would check with me each class. He's one of the clearest examples of the positive impact that I had on my students.","I learned that I can do good work even in very trying circumstances, that I will speak up on behalf of myself and my colleagues when I feel like things aren't being done right or we aren't being respected, and that I am stubborn enough to finish my commitments, even when they are challenging.","The most challenging aspect of this was feeling exploited and under appreciated. The benefits of participating in this program absolutely were not worth the amount of stress and effort that I had to put in. While I fulfilled all of my requirements, from teaching more hours than were required, completing the same duties that would be expected from an Ecuadorian teacher and creating a quite detailed, thorough projects, I felt like I didn't get adequate recognition from either my school or from the staff of World Teach.

There are so many situations and things that happen that you have to deal with that don't happen to you elsewhere.

",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,,Agree,What sorts of resources were going to be useful to me in my teaching setting.,"I have so many, as cliche as that sounds. I had loads of great days, loads of bad days, and loads of days that were a mix of the two. My best memories tend to cluster around spur-of-the-moment activities or trips. Though it can be frustrating, I love how flexible life is on the outer islands. I loved when people would invite on last-minute adventures and always saying yes. I also has a great time whenever I was with the other volunteers, not just at my site placement. Learning together about our adopted home was a great experience, and just spending time with like-minded people was restorative. ","The most interesting thing I've learned about myself through this experience is realizing that I'm truly capable of doing whatever I set my mind to doing. While I've never considered myself a fearful person, i definitely think I've lost a bit of that hesitation most of us carry with us, those second thoughts that stop us from going out and doing the things we feel we should. Now that I'm back home, I notice that a lot. It's like no, don't doubt yourself. You can do whatever it is you're wanting to do. Don't wait around for someone else's permission. ","The most difficult thing about my experience was definitely the isolation. I lived on an island with no internet, phone, or reliable planes/boats. I would sometimes go months without hearing from my friends and family back home. That could get really hard, a lot harder than I thought it could be. ","I think a lot of different sorts of people can come out here and have really successful experiences with this program. But you definitely need to be flexible and open to doing things and working well outside your comfort zone. You have to be patient and willing to look silly, and you have to love kids. And even if you're not a glass-half-full kind of person, you have to constantly tell yourself that you are. A positive outlook is pretty important. That's what's going to allow you to get through the bad stuff and enjoy the good, and walk away from this experience as a more fulfilled person.","WorldTeach is a great program for anyone interested in getting out of their regular routine and doing some good at the same time. You don't have to have a load of experience teaching, just a willingness to learn and to make mistakes (and learn from those as well). It is a big commitment, and you have to know going into something like this that working with this program is not about you. While you are going to be impacted by the experience, you'll be there to teach and to work with your community. You're going to be a role model for your students. This is not the sort of program centered on finding yourself or just having a good time. Those things can and do happen, but they can't be your priority.

We are very different people with very different living styles, so much so that I find it laughable that we ended up living together, though I understand logistically why we did. To get through the year with him I had to dig down deep for patience that I didn't have, and, to be honest, I complained about him to anyone who would listen. People probably hated me for it, but it made me feel better. Though, in some ways this backfired on me and created a new set of problems for me to handle because the people who I initially confided in about my roommate ended up driving me crazy by midway through the year, but because I didn't want word of any gossip I shared about my roommate to get back to him (because I still had to live with him), I maintained those relationships even though there were times I probably would have preferred if a coconut fell on my head. ","Beyond being patient, resilient, etc., good volunteers need to be energetic and ready to engage their community.

The school building itself is very old and falling apart which lead to a lot of problems in itself.  The students' level of achievement was very far behind when I arrived and the multi grade-level classrooms were very difficult to accommodate.

Because you also get your first one-and-a-half stipends during Orientation, I had plenty of money to cover myself through Orientation with money still left over.  However, as I mentioned, I spent much less than a lot of the other volunteers during my time in Majuro, and some spent upwards of $500.  It just depends on your spending habits.  Throughout the rest of the year, my stipend money was plenty to cover all my needs with still a large chunk left over at the end of the year.

We quickly realized, however, that swimming was just a more contained and controllable analogy of our experiences as volunteers. Through training, we became comfortable and more adept at handling the difficulties and dangers of the open waters. However, the phantom danger of sharks and rip tides were constant reminders that every time we entered the water we trespassed in another a world--a world outside of our element. When you live and teach on a remote island, you are always outside of your element. What is important, is learning how to float. WorldTeach was instrumental in giving us the training and constant support needed to not just float, but swim as teachers. The field director offered constant emotional and professional support, which functioned as a lifeline when necessary. Working with a program like this gives you a community to buoy you up when you feel overwhelmed, and the skills needed to help you function independently.

It was our first time in the deep open water, and we encountered three sharks along the way. It was incredibly satisfying to see our larger goal become more attainable through the accomplishment of this stepping stone.

As an introvert with a social anxiety disorder, speaking in front of people is a major phobia and typically a paralyzing experience.

It was really gratifying.  ","I think the lack of activity in an outer island can be very difficult. There is a certain level of monotony involved in life out here, and when you're irritable or tired that lack of activity, social variation, or options can feel oppressive.
