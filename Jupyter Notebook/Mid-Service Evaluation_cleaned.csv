I had never taught a class and I am not even an education major. Teaching at A.P Lutali has given me such a rose colored experience of what it must be like to be a teacher. The administration is helpful as long as you practice Fa’a Samoa and respect your elders no matter what. The students can be challenging at times but they are so loving and helpful too when you show them love and respect as well.   I expected to grow a lot personally, in a physical, mental, and emotional way. I wanted this experience to help me become a more confident and independent person, and it has, but not in the way I'd thought. Being in American Samoa has taught me a new sense of responsibility, I grew up in a big family with strong family values. I learned that family came before everyone else, and in American Samoa I found that family includes everyone else. Being Independent doesn’t mean doing everything on your own, it means finding time to be alone, and knowing when you need to take care of yourself verse taking care of the community. Living on the not so outer island of Aunu’u there is no way to avoid the community, I’ve learned a new type of patience that I never thought I could attain. I also learned how to deal with personal problems becoming the talk of the village. I have successfully accepted Samoa for everything it is, I may not agree with the way everything works but I know it is not my place to try and change it.  ","Samoa can be frustrating, as a girl from a big city I was not prepared for how slow life goes here. However, once I accepted that everything was going to move on “Samoan time” I quickly adapted. I think the most challenging thing about my experience in American Samoa is the constant sexual harassment in a small community. I know I am safe and not in any eminent danger, but it is difficult for me to accept the rude and disrespectful comments. The older men in the village will make remarks in front of the young boys, the men my age will make comments to you and to one another, and the young boys see this behavior and think it is okay to make the same remarks. Feeling powerless to stop something that I feel so strongly about has been challenging.","basketball shorts, hair products, dresses, more spandex, leave in conditioner (for curly hair)",socks,"I wish I knew the reality of how quickly gossip spreads in a tiny community, I have never lived in a city with less than 700,000 people so moving to an island with 400 people was a shock to me. The kids hear, see, and know EVERYTHING, so something you may casually do in the states like walk out of the house with your tattoo showing, or make a friend of the opposite gender will become the talk of the town.

I'm continually spending nights, early mornings, and weekends working on lessons, while the other volunteers seem able to breeze right through teaching. I feel it's my fault, because I've had meetings with both Melissa (the new Field Director) and Matthew from the home office, and I've read multiple books on teaching ESL in addition to being very engaged in PLCs, and despite all of that I still struggle to plan for 18-20 classes per week in a reasonable amount of time. As a result, I've been a lot more disconnected from the local culture and unhappy than I would have expected, simple due to exhaustion. I haven't learned any more Thai than what I learned in my first month in the country, and have at times been pretty depressed, in part because I don't have much time for myself.    Another thing I've been disappointed by is lack of group cohesion. Even during orientation, most of the volunteers wanted to do their own thing and voted against group outings and dinners. I had hoped there would be more community and supporting of one other, and the absence of that led me to feel pretty isolated here at times.    Relatedly: while Gen (the former Field Director) was fantastic in the first month, immediately after we went to our teaching sites, I felt unsupported. In addition to my struggles with lesson planning, I also struggled with some of my school's demands and figuring things out in my community, and I felt like Gen didn't take my problems seriously. And while she promised us a site visit after a month of teaching, none of the volunteers got one; most of us didn't even get a site visit by the time she departed in March. By the last few months of her tenure, she seemed entirely checked out, and while I sympathized with her stress of starting a new job; even so, it seemed unfair to us, her current responsibility. She was often out of the country and it was implied (or explicitly stated) that we couldn't contact her unless it was an emergency. Her arms'-length approach to managing us also bred an atmosphere of unaccountability among the volunteers which I have found discouraging at times: when volunteers complain about PLCs, or mid-service, or skip out responsibilities like sending in lesson plans or talk about how nothing matters because ""they're not going to fire us,"" it makes me feel like what I'm doing doesn't matter. I think this attitude could have been avoided had Gen held people more accountable, and I think Melissa can attest to some of the difficulties this has caused for her.    Melissa has been a fantastic Field Director so far, and her attention, meticulousness, and responsiveness is highly appreciated and a big improvement.","more sunscreen and vitamins, more tech fabric undershirts, a power bank for my cell phone","hiking boots, bug spray","It's hard to get a square meal where all your dietary needs are met -- especially vegetables.

When I agreed to take part in the program, I was doing so with the reassurance of WorldTeach's great reputation for supporting its teachers. The whole reason that I chose to do a program such as this was so that I would not be completely at the mercy of a school in a new country/ culture - I had read horror stories of people being hired directly by schools and suffering poor working conditions etc, so thought that WorldTeach would take the form of a safety net, if, for any reason, I had a problem at my school.     However, my assumption has not been fulfilled on the Ecuador fellowship. Whenever myself or any of my colleagues have had any problems at their school, we have simply been told ""Well, that is at the discretion of your directors at your school"", ""We can't help you"". The impression that I have got from WorldTeach throughout this process, is that you simply do not have any power to actually help us in our schools (tough public schools where the directors (who we are apparently under the complete discretion of) want to work us as hard as possible). This has led to many unfair situations. For example, in February, there was a holiday, which was technically 'just for teachers'. However, the vast majority of my colleagues' schools agreed for them to have the time off (perfectly reasonable, given that this education system offers teachers the bare minimum of holiday, and there were no students in any schools). However, WorldTeach  sent us an email, the day before the last day of school, stating that teachers should be working and that having the holiday was ""At the discretion of our directors"". I do not understand why WorldTeach could not have given us permission to have that holiday - we work very hard with difficult students, and there were no classes that week - just a couple of meetings being given in a language most of us don't understand very well. I felt that WorldTeach either didn't care, or simply did not have the power to help us. Which I totally understand, but if you can't even give us permission to miss a week during which there are no classes, how can we rely on you for any support if things go wrong in the schools? This lack of real power in the schools is also reflected in the fact that some of us will be forced to work in JULY! Some teachers will be able to travel for the month or even return home to the United States while others will be trapped in their schools! The unfairness is obvious to see. Again, July is 'At the discretion of our directors'.     I do emphasize with WorldTeach, as not having any power to help volunteers must be frustrating. But, at the same time, this makes me question why WorldTeach are actually conducting this program. I have heard such amazing things about your volunteer programs throughout the world, but this certainly is not reflected in the Ecuador fellowship.     My next disappointment is related to another expectation I had of WT, based on what I read online - Training. WorldTeach has a reputation for offering great, 3 weeks - 1 month-long orientations. Your staff have been kind enough to point out how 'tough' this program is. However, it has been made extra tough by the fact that we were given 3 days of orientation, and then sent out to our very difficult schools. If the teaching is so tough (which it certainly is), why were we given no training? I was and continue to be totally unprepared. The staff conducting the training really tried their best, but they could not cover anything in 3 days! We were just shipped off to random schools. I understand that this is the first year of the program, but it did not need to be this tough.",Teaching materials - colored board markers etc,,That WorldTeach would not be able to support us in our schools.,My experience falls short of my initial expectations,"My greatest disappointment of this whole experience has to be with WorldTeach overall. When I agreed to take part in the program, I was doing so with the reassurance of WorldTeach's great reputation for supporting its teachers. The whole reason that I chose to do a program such as this was so that I would not be completely at the mercy of a school in a new country/ culture - I had read horror stories of people being hired directly by schools and suffering poor working conditions etc, so thought that WorldTeach would take the form of a safety net, if, for any reason, I had a problem at my school.     However, my assumption has not been fulfilled on the Ecuador fellowship. Whenever myself or any of my colleagues have had any problems at their school, we have simply been told ""Well, that is at the discretion of your directors at your school"", ""We can't help you"". The impression that I have got from WorldTeach throughout this process, is that you simply do not have any power to actually help us in our schools (tough public schools where the directors (who we are apparently under the complete discretion of) want to work us as hard as possible). This has led to many unfair situations. For example, in February, there was a holiday, which was technically 'just for teachers'. However, the vast majority of my colleagues' schools agreed for them to have the time off (perfectly reasonable, given that this education system offers teachers the bare minimum of holiday, and there were no students in any schools). However, WorldTeach  sent us an email, the day before the last day of school, stating that teachers should be working and that having the holiday was ""At the discretion of our directors"". I do not understand why WorldTeach could not have given us permission to have that holiday - we work very hard with difficult students, and there were no classes that week - just a couple of meetings being given in a language most of us don't understand very well. I felt that WorldTeach either didn't care, or simply did not have the power to help us. Which I totally understand, but if you can't even give us permission to miss a week during which there are no classes, how can we rely on you for any support if things go wrong in the schools? This lack of real power in the schools is also reflected in the fact that some of us will be forced to work in JULY! Some teachers will be able to travel for the month or even return home to the United States while others will be trapped in their schools! The unfairness is obvious to see. Again, July is 'At the discretion of our directors'.     I do emphasize with WorldTeach, as not having any power to help volunteers must be frustrating. But, at the same time, this makes me question why WorldTeach are actually conducting this program. I have heard such amazing things about your volunteer programs throughout the world, but this certainly is not reflected in the Ecuador fellowship.     My next disappointment is related to another expectation I had of WT, based on what I read online - Training. WorldTeach has a reputation for offering great, 3 weeks - 1 month-long orientations. Your staff have been kind enough to point out how 'tough' this program is. However, it has been made extra tough by the fact that we were given 3 days of orientation, and then sent out to our very difficult schools. If the teaching is so tough (which it certainly is), why were we given no training? I was and continue to be totally unprepared.

I could have used time at the beginning of the program (after confirming our placements, perhaps) to develop the first few weeks of classes, and have my peers review my lesson plans.

Students in 9th and 10th grade are less interested in learning and lack the maturity to appreciate the English opportunity.

Understanding that the Global Education Fellowship is a brand new program and that things change quickly, I think that communication has been an issue.  From not finding out our host families until the day before we moved in with them, to finding out that there wasn't a two-week February break a couple days before the alleged break (even though all the teachers at our schools already knew the academic calendar had been changed, meaning that Edificar and WT could have provided the correct information during orientation), to lag time and sometimes unhelpful communications with field staff (e.g. even though we are required to submit weekly check-ins, they often don't fully read or address our concerns), communications and information flow has been challenging at times.  I really value our fellowship cohort, however with a new program, communications issues could have potentially been less of an issue with a smaller group.  Additionally, we are all mature adults, so transparency is important and could have diminished some frustrations.     School administrators and the other English teacher at my school sometimes don't fully explain things, and then get mad when something is due that I am unaware of and therefore don't submit.

There are certainly frustrations (i.e. book that offer no assistance on explaining/understanding largely irrelevant grammar points) but nothing overwhelming.     One small comment I would like to make regarding the WT Ecuador program in general is that there seems to be a feeling among field staff that volunteers need to be policed. The staff has taken steps towards addressing this (and I applaud them in this--they work very hard and seem to be open to criticism and change) but I wanted to reiterate that, as a part of this program, we are professionals and should be treated with a degree of respect. When we have assignments that need to be completed, it is wildly inappropriate and unprofessional to threaten to put negative marks in a RECOMMENDATION LETTER if something is not done on time. This is not to say we as volunteers do not have meet the FS halfway by being professional and prompt with required documents, but it is appalling that FS would threaten to mar over 10 months of dedicated service and hard work for not turning in 1 worksheet on time (as far as I'm aware, nothing has been late, but the principal that ONE mistake would negate 10 months of hardwork is ridiculous). Further, the PLC, the task that has repeatedly been the source of many of the aforementioned threats, is poorly organized and even FS don't know the answers to many of the volunteer questions. It seems odd that a program/task so disorganized would pushed onto volunteers (at the potential cost of a recommendation) without the Field Staff knowing exactly how it should be carried out (this is not to say that the PLC is useless--I quite like the overall task--I just don't like being threatened over an already confusing series of tasks).    Finally, I do not mean to condemn FS, as I said before, they have been working hard to take volunteer criticism into account and have been helpful in many regards. The only reason I mention the scenario above is because I want to make sure that all volunteer work is not negated by a potential small mistake (i.e. turn something in late, no recommendations for you...good luck finding a job or getting into grad school), especially as field staff do not seem to be above mistakes themselves (if they make 1 mistake, will it be reflected in their letter of recommendation?).

I was just talking to a friend on the phone last night and called Ecuador my home. I hadn't even realized I had been doing this until my friend pointed it out to me. Personally, I feel like this has been one of my biggest accomplishments. Moving to Ecuador was unknown and honestly very intimidating. I wasn't sure how I would handle it. Through my time here I have surprised myself with how much I have grown. Little things that used to intimidate me are now a part of my everyday. I have surprised myself by being more open to try new things and being more outgoing. I have also worked hard to make myself comfortable here. I find little places that I can go to on my own and sit and be quiet for a little while. These moments allow me to step back for a while and really process my experience here. While doing that, I have also been able to reflect on my time as a teacher here. I have experience teaching children at home, so moving here and teaching a high level of English at a university was very intimidating. Professionally, my biggest accomplishment was the way I built relationships with my students. The English that my students have to learn is incredibly difficult and many times I have to study/teach it to myself before presenting it to the class. This can be very challenging and a lot of the times I would rely on my students to work through sentences with me. All this being said, I was far from being the worlds greatest English teacher, but I was someone who my students could trust and rely on and for me that was the greatest thing I could have done. ","My greatest frustration has to be the speed that I have been learning Spanish. I think I just assumed that I would catch on really quickly and would be fluent by the end of the year, but I learned very quickly that that would not be the case. Probably around 85% of my day is spent speaking English, which makes learning Spanish more difficult. In order to change this, I am planning on enrolling in Spanish classes to practice more and participate in more language exchange opportunities. I am learning, but it is happening at a slower pace then I anticipated. ","Slippers and a lot of warm socks! My house is freezing and for the first few months they were the one thing I missed from home. I ended up having my mom send me them from home. Also, a good day backpack for hiking trips/vacations. Most people only have their big luggage and their teaching bags, so one of my favorite things is my daypack! Also, I'm so thankful I invested in comfortable shoes. We walk a lot!",I use everything I brought. ,"I think WorldTeach did a good job of informing us about Ecuador before coming. Many of the things I have learned here couldn't be told to me beforehand, I had to experience them myself. The only thing I can think of that I wish I had known before coming is the fact that Ecuador really isn't an inexpensive country. Everything here is comparable to U.S. prices. Having spent a significant amount of time in Bolivia, I guess I was expecting my money to go further than it has. Really the only inexpensive things are almuerzos and bus rides but other than that I would tell anyone who is planning on coming to have a fair amount of money in their savings to travel and do things on the weekends/in the evenings. ",My experience exceeds my initial expectations,"Again, I tried not to come in with many initial expectations.

WorldTeach emphasized its value to the nth degree but offered NO truly effective past examples that could be used as templates. Many teachers I know no longer use tacking systems at all.
