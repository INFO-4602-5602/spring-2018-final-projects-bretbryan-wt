It would have also been nice to have multiple airport pick ups available because I legitimately could not get a flight to come at 5 p.m. which is why I left the day before and had to arrange taxi and accommodation for myself. It didn't seem like there was any flexibility in terms of pick up and that also led to certain people missing the first orientation dinner because they had later flights.

A lot of them are simply here because they followed their significant other, simply want to party and travel, or just don't know what to do with their lives so they went abroad--in other words, they have no genuine interest for teaching. For instance, there was a group of individuals here that had pictures on FB where they were dressed as ""Mexocans"" for Halloween. How could worldteach allow for people like that to go into a Latin American country to teach?
